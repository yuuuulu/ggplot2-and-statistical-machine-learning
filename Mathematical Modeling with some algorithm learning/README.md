## Modeling
###    Thanks to XJTLU for supporting us in taking part in the modeling competition. Though we did not get a satisfying result because of the simple models that we used and our shallow level of understanding even basic knowledge, we know what we want----we will always keep going. I love math! I love statistics. So I love modeling! "All models are not true but some are meaningful."
